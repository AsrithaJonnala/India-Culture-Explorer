## About The Project

India-Culture-Explorer is an interactive digital encyclopedia that allows users to embark on a visual journey through the heritage of India. The motivation behind this project was to create a single, beautiful, and modern platform where anyone could easily access and learn about the unique cultural aspects of each state.

The user experience begins with an engaging animated homepage, leading to a gallery of all 28 states. From there, users can dive deep into any state to discover its famous food, traditional dance forms (with GIFs), cultural outfits, and major tourist destinations.

## Core Features

* **Multi-Page Navigation:** A seamless user experience with distinct pages for Home, the States Gallery, and State Details, powered by React Router.
* **Fully Data-Driven:** The application is built to be scalable. All 28 states are rendered dynamically from a central `data.js` file, meaning new content can be added without changing the core code.
* **Interactive UI:** Smooth animations on page loads, hover effects on cards, and an animated homepage background create an attractive and modern user experience, built with Framer Motion.
* **Comprehensive Details:** Each state's page includes high-quality images and GIFs to provide a rich, visual understanding of its culture.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
